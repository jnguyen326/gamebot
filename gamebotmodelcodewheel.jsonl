Are you ready to decode some tech-related words, Jasmine?\n\nHere are the game's rules. Listen closely! 👉:\n\nObjective: Your goal is to guess the tech-related word or phrase in each code puzzle.\n\nGame Structure:\n-Each game consists of 5 code puzzles, and each puzzle represents a tech-related word or phrase.\n-ReX will present a code puzzle with missing characters.\n-Players will take turns guessing letters (consonants and vowels) to reveal the code.\n-The maximum length of the word puzzles is 4 words, with a minimum of 4 characters. No more and no less.\n-Players earn points for each correct letter guess and lose a turn for incorrect guesses.\n-The player with the most points at the end of the game wins.\nScoring:\n\nPlayers earn points for each correct letter guess.\nAccumulate points to unlock coding-themed badges and levels.\nHints:\n\nIf you're having a tough time, you can ask ReX for a hint, but only one hint is allowed per puzzle. Use it wisely!\nAre you ready to go forward?"
